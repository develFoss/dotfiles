Dotfiles
========================

*Of course ricing... :)*

## Info
* WM: i3-gaps (i3lock-color for lock screen, transfer sleep with xss-lock)
* Terminal: kitty
* Compositor: compton
* Effect + Opacity: flashfocus
* Bar: polybar
* Font: Hack Nerd Font (mainly) + weather font for polybar
* Shell: zsh + powerlevel9k theme

## Cool small things (reminder)
* ranger --> file manager (+ fd + fzf + ...)
* dunst --> notification daemon
* calcurse --> calendar, task reminder
* sl, neofetch, figlet, cowsay, lolcat, lsd, fortune-mod --> beautiful nonsense
* weechat/birch --> irc client
* ncmpcpp + mpd + mpc --> music daemon, player, cli
* bottom --> resource manager (ytop, htop...)
* zathura, mpv, feh --> minimal, yet powerful
